### HOW TO CREATE A CUSTOM DOCKER REPOSITORY

This tutorial will walk you through making a simple docker that allows you to assemble with Ray and predict ORFs with Prodigal as done in the prior tutorials. Before you can do this, you will need to visit the Docker website and create an account (if you don't have one already).

```sh
- Go to www.docker.com
- Enter a login name, email address, and password 
- Go do your email and verify account creation
- Once you have verified your account go to 'login' and enter your credentials
- https://hub.docker.com/account/login/
```

- Create a repository by clicking the blue '+ Add Repository \/' Button on the right hand side of the screen. If you can't see the button, make sure you have selected 'Summary' on the left had side under your login ID.
- The repository will need a name.  I will name mine 'Gulpereel' for this tutoria
- Provide a description like 'Hello World docker repository'
- select 'public' (private cost money)
- push 'Create Repository'. This creates a repository to which you can push a docker you create

- Go to a Linux environment that has Docker installed.  This can be a droplet, boot2docker on your laptop, or a Linux PC. The first step will be to pull a basic Linux installation from which we can make modifications.

```sh
docker pull centos
```sh
This command pulls the latest version of centos. By default the latest verion is pulled. 'docker pull ubuntu' will pull Ubuntu 14.04.  The pull make take a second. After all image layers are downloaed, you can inspect which images are present on your machine using

```sh
docker images
```

- Your output will look something like this:

```sh
REPOSITORY           TAG                    IMAGE ID                CREATED            VIRTUAL SIZE
bwawrik/qiime        latest                 c7b8ab1b04fc            12 days ago          5.935 GB
centos               latest                 fd44297e2ddb            3 weeks ago         215.47 MB
```

You should see an image tagged as REPOSITORY = 'centos'  and TAG = 'latest'.  The nomenclature for this repository is centos:latest. Alternatively, the repository can be identified with the IMAGE ID. In my case IMAGE ID = ' fd44297e2ddb'. This will be important further down.

- Now lets run your docker

```sh
docker run -t -i centos:latest
```

First, you will need to install some dependencies for Ray and Prodigal, which we will install below. 'Yum' is a package manager used by centos. It is similar to 'apt-get' under ubuntu. First update Yum

```sh
yum update
```
note: select 'yes' throughout the process when prompted

- Now install the needed dependencies

```sh
yum install nano wget -y
yum groupinstall -y 'Development Tools' -y
yum install zlib-devel.x86_64yum install sudo -y
yum install openmpi.x86_64 openmpi-devel.x86_64
yum install mpich2.x86_64 mpich-devel.x86_64 mpich.x86_64 -y
```

- Make a directory to deploy software

```sh
mkdir -p /opt/local/software
```

- Install Prodigal 2.50

```sh
cd /opt/local/software
wget http://prodigal.ornl.gov/zips/prodigal.v2_50.tar.gz
gunzip prodigal.v2_50.tar.gz
tar -xvf prodigal.v2_50.tar
cd prodigal.v2_50
make
cd /usr/local/bin
sudo ln -s /opt/local/software/prodigal.v2_50/prodigal ./prodigal
```

- Install Ray 2.3.2

```sh
cd /opt/local/software
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/denovoassembler/files/Ray-2.3.1.tar.bz2
bunzip2 Ray-2.3.1.tar.bz2
tar -xvf Ray-2.3.1.tar
cd Ray-2.3.1
make prefix=ray-build MAXKMERLENGTH=64 MPICXX=/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin/mpicxx
make install
mv install-prefix/ ray-build/
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/software/Ray-2.3.1/ray-build' | tee -a ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/openmpi/bin' | tee -a ~/.bashrc
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/lib64/openmpi/lib' | tee -a ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

- You will now need to commit your changes. First you'll need to exit the docker. Then you will need to find the 'container' that contains all the software you just installed.

```sh
exit
```

Note: on occasion you get the message 'There are stopped jobs.'. In that case, you will need to type 'exit' again until you exit the docker.

Find the last container that was edited:

```sh
docker ps -l
```
- In my case, I got:

```sh
CONTAINER ID  IMAGE           COMMAND        CREATED            STATUS        PORTS               NAMES
206278e38cd6  centos:latest   "/bin/bash"    19 minutes ago     Exited                            mad_einstein
```

- Find your CONTAINER ID and commit your changes

```sh
docker commit 206278e38cd6
```

- You should get a long hash tag as confirmation. In my case here:
```sh
1b9db728ff675cd69d4767b27f2cedb230c024885f743b4522683a1e1640c268
```

- You will now need to tag your docker image. To do this, you will need to find the new IMAGE ID

```sh
docker images
```

- Note the new untagged image that appeared in my list:

```sh
REPOSITORY           TAG                    IMAGE ID                CREATED            VIRTUAL SIZE
<none>               <none>                 1b9db728ff67            2 minutes ago      1.03 GB
bwawrik/qiime        latest                 c7b8ab1b04fc            12 days ago        5.935 GB
centos               latest                 fd44297e2ddb            3 weeks ago        215.47 MB
```

- Tag your image with REPOSITORY and a TAG identifying the version'

```sh
docker tag IMAGE ID <dockerID>/<repository>:version
```

In my case, this command was: 

```sh
docker tag 1b9db728ff67 bwawrik/gulpereel:version_1
```

You can re-list your images to see if it worked:

```sh
 images
```

Te new untagged image that appeared in my list.

```
REPOSITORY           TAG                    IMAGE ID                CREATED             VIRTUAL SIZE
bwawrik/gulpereel     version_1             1b9db728ff67            2 minutes ago       1.03 GB
bwawrik/qiime         latest                c7b8ab1b04fc            12 days ago         5.935 GB
centos                latest                fd44297e2ddb            3 weeks ago         215.47 MB
```

There is only one thing left to do - push your new docker to your repository:

```sh
docker push REPOSITORYl:TAG
```

In my example:

```sh
docker push bwawrik/gulpereel:version_1
```

If this is your first commit from your computer since booting up the VM, the command prompt will ask you for your ID, password, and email address. Enter those and sit back. The push can take a little while.

You are now ready to pull your assembly & gene prediction docker on any other machine.
